# Kaun Banega Arabpati
This project is inpsired from the show **Kaun Banega Crorepati**, which is an Indian Quiz show where people can participate with the grand opportunity to win a ton of money. 

A 'Arab' is an indian unit of counting money, which means *100 crore* Indian rupees or one billion Indian Rupees. 

The idea behind using such humongous amount of money for a quiz show was to thinking of this game-show being set in 2050's, where, due to inflation, today's currency standards feel like pocket change.
