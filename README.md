# Kaun Banega Neelpati
This project is inpsired from the show **Kaun Banega Crorepati**, which is an Indian Quiz show where people can participate with the grand opportunity to win a ton of money. 
A 'neel' is an indian unit of counting money, which means *ten lakh crore* Indian rupees or ten trillion Indian Rupees. 
The idea behind using such humongous amount of money for a quiz show was to thinking of this game-show being set in 2100's, where, due to inflation, today's currency standards feel like pocket change.
